<b>Question 01</b><br>
Assume that you have a text file with several records of four values (acceleration, time, initial velocity
and initial position). Develop a GUI program that computes the distance an object falls in Earth's gravity.
The formula in Math notation is: x(t) = 0.5 × at2 + vit + xi
Your program should have “Read Data” and “Reset” buttons and textfields.. If “Read Data” button is
clicked, read the next record from the file and display the values read from the file in the textfields.
Include a button “Compute Distance” that will print the distance using the above formula. If there are
no records to read disable the “Read Data” button. The “Reset” should be enabled only when “Read Data”
is disabled and upon clicking the “Reset” button, enable the “Read Data”.
Variable Meaning Value
 a Acceleration (m/s2) -9.81
 t Time (s) 10
 vi Initial velocity (m/s) 0
 xi Initial position 0
Note: The correct value is -490.5 m. Java will output more digits after the decimal place, but that is
unimportant.
